React Hooks -

UseState() -

UseEffect(callbackfunction, [dependency array]) - 
if no dependency array, useEffect will get called on every time componet renders. 
if dependecyte array is empty, useEffect will get called only once(only initial render) 
if dependecy array is let [btnName], useEffect will get called everytime btnName changes.
dependecy array will change the behaviour of UseEffect.

Best Practices - 
Never create useState variable outside your component.
Try to call all the hooks on the top of component.
Never create useState inside if/else.
Never cerate state variables inside function or for loop.
state variables meant to created at the top level inside functional components.
