React Hooks -

UseState() -

UseEffect(callbackfunction, [dependency array]) - 
if no dependency array, useEffect will get called on every time componet renders. 
if dependecyte array is empty, useEffect will get called only once(only initial render) 
if dependecy array is let [btnName], useEffect will get called everytime btnName changes.
dependecy array will change the behaviour of UseEffect.

Best Practices - 
Never create useState variable outside your component.
Try to call all the hooks on the top of component.
Never create useState inside if/else.
Never cerate state variables inside function or for loop.
state variables meant to created at the top level inside functional components.

Routing In React - 
Library  - React router dom.
createBrowserRouter to create routes.
path : "pathname"
element:<Component/>
RouterProvider is use to provide routing configuration to app.
ErrorElement - to show the error page/component.
useRouteError - hook given by react router dom for error.it gives you more information about the error.
<Outlet/> - is used to render view specific content based on route path.
Outlet will be replaced by component at runtime and based on the active route.
never ever use an anchor tag for routing in react.
Link - is used to create link in react instead of anchor tag.

There are 2 types of routing in web apps - 
client side routing - we are not making any network calls.
server side routing - ite reloads the whole page & makes the network call.Page comes from server

useParams hook - 

to fetch router data form the route.
key should be applied to parent element
