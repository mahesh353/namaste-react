Style - 

{} - we can write styles inside JSX as well but it is not recommended. it is always recommended to write styles in separate
css file.

React Props/properties -
- which we can use to pass data to components.
- Props are just like passing normal arguments to functions.
- Props are used to pass data dynamically to components.
- we can do destructuring as well.
{resName, cuisine} = prop;

Config driven UI - 
Our website is driven by config.
Controlling your UI using data/config & this config comes from database.
Whenever we are looping over the list using map function we need to always provide the key in react.
becuase if id is not given react will re render all the items/cards & its time consuming process & it makes ui slow & takes a performance hit.
if unique id is given then react does not re render all items/cards, react rerender only new items/card.
React official documentation says that never use index as a key in react.index as a key is an antipattern.
