Redux - 

Redux is not mandatory - 
Redux & React are different libraries.
React offer you a great solution for data management.
handling state of an application.
Redux toolkit - new way of writing redux.
why redux toolkit -
1) Configuring the redux store is too complicated.
2) I have to configure a lot of packages to get redux to do anything useful.
3)  Redux requires to much boilerplate code.

Redux store is big js object which is kept in global central place
slices inside redux store, logical separation of object.
cart slice, user slice.
we can not directly modify the cart slice.there is a way we can do that, if i clikc on add buttion it dispatches an action
it calls a function & this function will actually modify the cart.
what is this function -  is basically known as a reducer.

when we hit the add buttion it dispatches an action which calls the reducer function which modifies the slice of our redux store.

to read the data from the store we use selector & selector will modify the react component. this phenomeon is known as subscribing to the store.
which means that it is in sync with the store.

npm install @reactjs/toolkit
npm install react-redux

whenver you are subscribing to the store make sure you are subscribing to the right portion only.
dont subscribe to the whole store to avoid performance issues.

redux used immer library behind the scene to create immutable objects behind the scenes.

when you are dealing with very large application that deals with lot of components in that case only use the redux for small scale 
applications using redux is not good.
