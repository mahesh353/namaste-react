Monolith & Microservice architecture - 

Monolith - 

We have api,ui,auth,db,sms all code written inside one big project.

Microservice architecture - 

we have different services for diff job. UI,DB,Auth, API, SMS sending service. & all these services 
conbined together forms a big app. all these services talk to each other depends on the requirement.
this ia also known as SRP and separation of concern.

How to call backend services from API - 
there are 2 approaches
1) loading => api calll = > Render
2) loading => load ui => make api call => rerender the ui - this is the recommended approach in react.

useEffect(()=>
{
   console.log('called');
}, []) hook =>

1st parameter = callback function, this function will get called once your component is rendered.
2nd parameter = dependency array

if we want to do anything once component is rendered, you can use the useEffect callback function.

Shimmer UI - 
show something or empty cards to the user till the actual data gets loaded or rendered.

Conditional Rendering - Render the UI based on the Condition.

Whenever state variables changes react will rerenders the UI.
