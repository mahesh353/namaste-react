Everything that you can do using react, that you do using html/css/javascript or any other framework which is out there.
Then Why react?
gives you superpowers to build large production ready/optimized applications.

React Hooks -

Never keep your harcoded data in component folder.Never ever keep hardcoded string in your component.
put all these details in Utils.js/const.js/config.js

in One file we can have only one default export, we can not have multiple exports in one file.
so if we want to export multiple things from one file then we need to use named export.

Two types of export/import the data
1) Export default dataName - Normal/Default Export - export default {name of variable/componentname}
import variable/componentname from path

2) Named export - to export multiple things from one file. - to import names export we need to use {} brances.
export const name = "";
import {variable/componentname} from path

State Variable - 
Super powerfull variable - use react hooks
it maintains the state of the component/applications.

React hooks - 
a normal javascript function which is given to us by react.its a prebuild. 
function comes with some super power/its a utility function given by react.
Two most important hooks - 
-useState() - Use to create superpowerfull react variable.
-useEffect() - 

State Variable - its maintains the state of the variable.
Local State Variable - it keeps the data in sync with the UI.
const {listOfRestaurants}  = useSate();
const [listOfRestaurants] = useSate([]);

we can not directly modify the state of the variable, we need to do it using the function as a second argument to array

const [listOfRestaurants] = useSate([data,fn to update data]);

React is very fast in dom maipulation.

** Render - Whenever the state variables updates react will rerenders the component.


Virtual dom -  is not an actual DOM but its a representation of actual DOM. Object representation of jsx/react element or
component is nothing but the react virtual DOM.

React algorithm/reconciliation/react fibre/diff algorithm - find out the difference between 2 virtual dom (updated virtual DOM & old virtual DOM)
& actually update the dom.
it came/introduced in react 16
We are using react 18
react fibre is the new way of finding the diff & updating the dom.
finding out the difference between 2 virtual dom is fast as compare to finding out the difference between 2 html.

React fibre -

react is doing efficient dom manipulation.
