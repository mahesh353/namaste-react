JSX - Javascript syntax to create react elements.
Html or xml like syntax
JSX is not part of React. React & JSX both are different things. JSX makes developers life easy.
JSX is not html inside javascript.
JSX is not html.
JSX is a html like syntax.
JSX is not valid/Pure javascript. js engine does not understand this code.
Parcel => Babel is basically coverting/transpile JSX code to valid/pure javascript.
while giving attribute to JSX we need to follow camel casing ex - id, className, tabIndex etc.
JSX will take care about the xss attacks by sanitizing the data inside {}.
JSX expression must have only one parent element

React components -

1) Class based Components - old way of writing code/ uses javascript classes.
2) Functional Components - new way of writing code / uses javascript functions.
- its just a normal javascript function which return jsx code/or which returs react element.
- you can use normal function as well as arrow function to create functional components.

** Component composition - calling one component inside a another component.

{} - is used to render or evaluate the javascript expression.


React fragments -
<React.Fragment> </React.Fragment> - its a parent element for jsx instead of using div. its like an empty tag. or use
<></>


Questions - 

Can we have mumtiple root elements in react?

Code - 


//React.CreateElement => React elements - JS Object => HtmlElement(When we render it);
var heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "Namaste React123 !"
);

// JSX => React.CreateElement => React elements - JS Object => HtmlElement(When we render it);
// React Element
const jsxHeading = (
  <h1 id="heading" className="head">
    Namaste React using JSX !
  </h1>
);

const TitleComponent = () => (
  <h1 id="heading" className="head">
    Namaste React using JSX !
  </h1>
);

//React Components
const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div id="container">
        {/* <TitleComponent /> */}
        {jsxHeading}
        <h1> Namaste React Functional component !</h1>
      </div>
      <div></div>
    </>
  );
};
