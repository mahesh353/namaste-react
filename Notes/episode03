JSX is not valid/Pure javascript. js engine does not understand this code.
Parcel => Babel is basically coverting/transpile JSX code to valid/pure javascript.
while giving attribute to JSX we need to follow camel casing ex - id, className, tabIndex etc.
JSX will take care about the xss attacks by sanitizing the data inside {}.

React components -

1) Class based Components - old way of writing code/ uses javascript classes.
2) Functional Components - new way of writing code / uses javascript functions.
- its just a normal javascript function which return jsx code/or which returs react element.
- you can use normal function as well as arrow function to create functional components.

** Component composition - calling one component inside a another component.

{} - is used to render or evaluate the javascript expression.


React fragments -
<React.Fragment> </React.Fragment> - its a parent element for jsx instead of using div. its like an empty tag. or use
<></>
