** JSX - 
    Javascript syntax to create react elements.
    Html or xml like syntax
    JSX is not part of React. React & JSX both are different things. 
    JSX makes developers life easy.
    JSX is not html inside javascript.
    JSX is not html.
    JSX is a html like syntax.
    JSX is not valid/Pure javascript. js engine does not understand this code.

** Parcel - 
    Babel is basically coverting/transpiling JSX code to valid/pure javascript.
    While giving attribute to JSX we need to follow camel casing ex - id, className, tabIndex etc.
    JSX will take care about the xss attacks by sanitizing the data inside {}.
    JSX expression must have only one parent element

** React Components -
    1) Class based Components - Old way of writing code/ uses javascript classes.
    2) Functional Components - New way of writing code / uses javascript functions.
    Its just a normal javascript function which returns jsx code/or which returs react element.
    You can use normal function as well as arrow function to create functional components.

** Component composition - 
    Calling one component inside a another component.

** {} - 
    It is used to render or evaluate the javascript expression.

** React fragments -
    <React.Fragment> </React.Fragment> - 
    its a parent element for jsx instead of using div. its like an empty tag. or use <></>

** Questions - 
    Can we have mumtiple root elements in react?

** Code - 
    //React.CreateElement => React elements - JS Object => HtmlElement(When we render it);
    var heading = React.createElement(
                 "h1",
                  { id: "heading" },
                  "Namaste React123 !"  
                );

    JSX => React.CreateElement => React elements - JS Object => HtmlElement(When we render it);
    const jsxHeading = (
                    <h1 id="heading" className="head">
                    Namaste React using JSX !
                  </h1>
                );

    const TitleComponent = () => (
                    <h1 id="heading" className="head">
                      Namaste React using JSX !
                    </h1>
                  );

//React Components
const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div id="container">
        {/* <TitleComponent /> */}
        {jsxHeading}
        <h1> Namaste React Functional component !</h1>
      </div>
      <div></div>
    </>
  );
};


** NPM 

(Package Manager but it is not "node package manager!!")
📦 package.json & 🔒 package-lock.json

**Imp** I failed in few of the interviews because of not able to answer properly on npm even though having work experience.

I just wanted to spread the knowledge what I have learnt on package manager (npm) from Namaste React done by the great soul Akshay Saini 🚀

Important to know that package manager (NPM) plays a major role in web development. So, we should have a configuration file for npm, that will maintain all packages/dependencies which we need during development & production phase.

1️⃣ package.json - This configuration file is for package manager (npm)
✔ npm init - this initializer can be used to set up a new or existing npm package
Few important sections of this file -
✔ Scripts : We can keep few scripts to "starts or build or test" run easily.
"npm run start or npm start" instead of "npx parcel index.html"
📍 npx - it is used to execute the package (one time)
📍 npm - it is used to install/get any package/libraries into project

✔ Normal dependencies - these are required to run the application on development & production as well.
- npm install react or npm i react
- npm install react-dom or npm i react-dom

✔ Dev Dependencies - these are required only during development phase.
- npm install --save-dev parcel or npm i -D parcel

2️⃣ Package version details - "^2.9.3" or "~2.9.3" or "2.9.3"
2 - Major version
9 - Minor version
3 - Patches

▶ ^ keep this caret symbol if minor and patch wants to get upgraded automatically.
▶ ~ keep this tilde symbol if only patch wants to get upgraded automatically.
▶ Also, we can keep only the exact version like "2.9.3" if we want get the exact package.
▶ Major version cannot be updated automatically, it should be done manually as it will have more impact with new releases.

3️⃣ package-lock.json - It maintains the exact version of the package is installed on development server and also keeps dependent dependencies details.
✔ Transitive Dependency
React project needs ➡ parcel (bundler) ➡ parcel itself needs other dependencies one such dependency is Babel ➡ Babel also will have its own dependencies ➡ this is only called "Transitive dependencies"

4️⃣ .gitignore
✔ Keep all files which can be re-generated.
node_module, dist, .parcel-cache

5️⃣ package.json & package-lock.json - Using these files, we can re-generate/install all the dependencies required for the project to run on production or any system.
✔ npm install - this will install all packages/dependencies maintained in package.json and exact versions maintained in package-lock.json.
🔴 Do not update these files unnecessarily.
